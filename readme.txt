When you open the project clear player prefs from the edit.

Read the readme file for game instructions.

For some reason when the project is downloaded it doesn't start from the menu screen so you need to go to cube surfer asset -> scenes -> Menu scene then start the project. Another problem you might face is the screen ratio problem. Please set the the ratio to 9x16 aspect if the project doesn't open that way. You might also need to change the platform settings to android if it is not set to android.

Start the project. You will see 4 buttons. 

If you click play, the game will start from the first level with default character Ty. Move your finger left and right to move. Collect the cubes and the coins. Try to make It to the finish line without dying. When you reach to the finish line you can go to next level, main menu, restart the level, and quit the game. 

If you click how to play, you will see explanations on how to play the game. 

If you click characters, you can choose a character you like to play the game.

If you click levels, you will see how many levels there are and you can play any level that made it in the game by clicking the level buttons. 

When you finish all the levels you can pick any level you like to play again from levels.
